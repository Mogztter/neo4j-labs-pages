====
Neo4j Streams integrates Neo4j with Apache Kafka event streams, to serve as a source of data, for instance change data (CDC) or a sink to ingest any kind of Kafka event into your graph.

Our *Kafka Connect Plugin* offers the sink functionality.

The *Neo4j Server Extension* provides both sink and source, as it has also access to the transaction events.
It will also add *procedures* you can call to send and receive data from Kafka.
====

=== Availability & Installation			

You can install the Kafka Connect Neo4j Sink Plugin into Confluent Cloud or your own Connect instance.

Alternatively, you can add the Neo4j Server extension to your own installations.
Just download the matching release version into the plugins folder and configuring it according to the documentation (see below for both).

You can execute and test the integration using our Docker Compose setups.
